# Uninstall

A safe uninstaller is included in the project root.

Usage:

```bash
./uninstall-security-controls.sh           # interactive prompt
./uninstall-security-controls.sh --dry-run # preview
./uninstall-security-controls.sh -y        # no prompt
```

What it removes (if generated by the installer):
- .git/hooks/pre-push
- .githooks/pre-push.d/*security-pre-push
- .github/workflows/security.yml
- .github/workflows/pinning-validation.yml
- .security-controls and .security-controls-version
- docs/security (installed docs)
