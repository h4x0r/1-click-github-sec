## [1.4.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added
- **Final No-Brainer Security Controls**: 3 critical universal security checks
  - Large file detection (blocking) - prevents accidental commit of files >10MB to avoid repository bloat and potential sensitive data exposure
  - Technical debt monitoring (warning) - tracks TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments for code quality visibility
  - Empty file detection (warning) - identifies empty source files that may indicate incomplete implementation
