## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-21

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release

**1-Click Rust Security** - Enterprise-grade security controls for Rust projects, installed in seconds.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **25+ Security Controls** in pre-push hook validation
- **Cryptographic verification** for all components (SHA256 checksums)
- **Two-tier security architecture** (pre-push blocking + CI deep analysis)
- **Zero-configuration installation** with sensible defaults
- **Multi-project support** (Rust, non-Rust, hybrid projects)

#### Security Controls (Pre-Push Hook)
- Secret detection (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, API keys, private keys)
- Vulnerability scanning via cargo-deny
- GitHub Actions SHA pinning verification
- Test suite validation
- Code formatting enforcement
- License compliance checking
- Large file detection
- Commit signature verification
- Dependency version pinning checks
- Build script security analysis
- Documentation secret scanning
- Environment variable security
- Unsafe code monitoring
- File permission auditing
- Technical debt tracking
- And 10+ additional checks

#### Helper Tools
- **pinactlite** - Lightweight GitHub Actions pinning verifier and auto-pinner
- **gitleakslite** - Efficient secret scanner with configurable allow-listing

#### CI/CD Workflows
- Pinning validation workflow (ensures all actions are SHA-pinned)
- Shell script linting (shfmt + shellcheck)
- Documentation building and deployment
- End-to-end testing suite
- Installer self-test validation

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with quick-start guide
- Installation guide with multiple verification methods
- Architecture documentation
- Security controls reference
- Contributing guidelines
- YubiKey/Sigstore integration guide

#### Configuration
- Customizable security controls via `.security-controls/config.env`
- Secret detection allow-listing support
- Configurable tool selection (cargo-deny vs cargo-audit)
- Skip options for specific checks

### Security Features
- All GitHub Actions workflows use SHA-pinned actions
- Signed commits with Sigstore support
- Dependency lock file validation
- Supply chain attack prevention
- Comprehensive secret detection patterns

### Performance
- Pre-push validation completes in ~60 seconds
- Parallel execution of independent checks
- Smart caching for repeated operations
- Minimal overhead for developer workflow

### Platform Support
- Linux (primary)
- macOS (tested)
- Windows (via WSL)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- GitLab CI (basic support)

### Known Limitations
- Requires bash 4.0+
- Some Rust-specific checks require cargo toolchain
- GPG signature verification not yet implemented
- SBOM generation requires additional tools
