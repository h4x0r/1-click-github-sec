## [0.6.5] - 2025-09-28

### 🚫 Zero-Compromise Security Release

**CRITICAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENT** - All security scanning jobs now blocking for releases, implementing zero-compromise security posture.

### Security Enhancements
- **🚫 CodeQL SAST Analysis**: Now blocking (was analysis-only) - Application security vulnerabilities block releases
- **🚫 Supply Chain Security**: Now blocking (was analysis-only) - SHA pinning violations and dependency integrity issues block releases
- **🛡️ Complete Protection**: Zero-day protection through comprehensive static analysis
- **🔒 Consistent Security**: Same rigor applied to all security categories (known CVEs, application flaws, supply chain risks)

### Architecture Impact
- **Zero Security Gaps**: All major threat vectors now have blocking validation
- **Defense in Depth**: Comprehensive security gate with parallel validation
- **Enhanced Release Process**: Quality Assurance + ALL security scanning must pass
- **Supply Chain Attack Prevention**: Blocks malicious package substitution and SolarWinds-style attacks

### Philosophy
- **Zero-Compromise Security**: Block ALL critical security risks regardless of source
- **Application Security Parity**: Code vulnerabilities treated with same severity as known CVEs
- **Supply Chain Paranoia**: Assume all external dependencies are compromised until proven otherwise
- **Fail-Secure Design**: When in doubt, block rather than allow

### Breaking Changes
- **CodeQL failures now block releases** - Application security issues must be resolved
- **Supply chain issues now block releases** - SHA pinning and dependency integrity required
- **Longer CI times possible** - CodeQL analysis can take 5-10+ minutes

### Migration Guide
- **Existing projects**: May experience initial release blocks due to CodeQL findings
- **Recommended approach**: Review and address CodeQL security findings before release
- **Emergency bypass**: Use `--no-verify` git push flag only for critical hotfixes

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-21

### 🎉 Initial Release

**1-Click GitHub Security** - Security controls for multi-language projects, installed in seconds.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **25+ Security Controls** in pre-push hook validation
- **Cryptographic verification** for all components (SHA256 checksums)
- **Two-tier security architecture** (pre-push blocking + CI deep analysis)
- **Zero-configuration installation** with sensible defaults
- **Multi-project support** (Rust, non-Rust, hybrid projects)

#### Security Controls (Pre-Push Hook)
- Secret detection (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, API keys, private keys)
- Vulnerability scanning via cargo-deny
- GitHub Actions SHA pinning verification
- Test suite validation
- Code formatting enforcement
- License compliance checking
- Large file detection
- Commit signature verification
- Dependency version pinning checks
- Build script security analysis
- Documentation secret scanning
- Environment variable security
- Unsafe code monitoring
- File permission auditing
- Technical debt tracking
- And 10+ additional checks

#### Helper Tools
- **pinactlite** - Lightweight GitHub Actions pinning verifier and auto-pinner
- **gitleakslite** - Efficient secret scanner with configurable allow-listing

#### CI/CD Workflows
- Pinning validation workflow (ensures all actions are SHA-pinned)
- Shell script linting (shfmt + shellcheck)
- Documentation building and deployment
- End-to-end testing suite
- Installer self-test validation

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with quick-start guide
- Installation guide with multiple verification methods
- Architecture documentation
- Security controls reference
- Contributing guidelines
- YubiKey/Sigstore integration guide

#### Configuration
- Customizable security controls via `.security-controls/config.env`
- Secret detection allow-listing support
- Configurable tool selection (cargo-deny vs cargo-audit)
- Skip options for specific checks

### Security Features
- All GitHub Actions workflows use SHA-pinned actions
- Signed commits with Sigstore support
- Dependency lock file validation
- Supply chain attack prevention
- Comprehensive secret detection patterns

### Performance
- Pre-push validation completes in ~60 seconds
- Parallel execution of independent checks
- Smart caching for repeated operations
- Minimal overhead for developer workflow

### Platform Support
- Linux (primary)
- macOS (tested)
- Windows (via WSL)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- GitLab CI (basic support)

### Known Limitations
- Requires bash 4.0+
- Some Rust-specific checks require cargo toolchain
- GPG signature verification not yet implemented
- SBOM generation requires additional tools

---

### Installation

```bash
# Quick install with verification
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4x0r/1-click-github-sec/main/install-security-controls.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4x0r/1-click-github-sec/main/install-security-controls.sh.sha256
# VERIFY checksum before execution (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED - critical security practice)
sha256sum -c install-security-controls.sh.sha256
chmod +x install-security-controls.sh
./install-security-controls.sh
```
