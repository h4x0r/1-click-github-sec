üîÑ Safe Upgrade System for 1-Click GitHub Security

USAGE:
    $0 [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION:
    Safely upgrades security controls with user modification detection.
    Verifies file integrity before upgrade and provides interactive
    handling of customized files.

OPTIONS:
    --check             Check installation integrity (no upgrade)
    --upgrade           Perform safe upgrade with user confirmation
    --force             Force upgrade without confirmation (NOT recommended)
    --help              Show this help message

WORKFLOW:
    1. Detect current installation version
    2. Verify file integrity against known hashes
    3. Identify user-modified files
    4. Show diffs for modified files
    5. Ask user what to do with each modification
    6. Backup modified files before replacing
    7. Download and install new version
    8. Verify new installation

EXAMPLES:
    $0 --check          # Check current installation integrity
    $0 --upgrade        # Safe upgrade with interactive prompts
    $0 --force          # Force upgrade (skips confirmations)

SAFETY FEATURES:
    ‚úÖ Version-specific hash verification
    ‚úÖ User modification detection
    ‚úÖ Interactive diff display
    ‚úÖ Per-file upgrade decisions
    ‚úÖ Automatic backup of modified files
    ‚úÖ Rollback capability
