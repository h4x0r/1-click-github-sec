## üéØ Project Mission

**1-Click GitHub Security** provides cryptographically verified, comprehensive security controls for multi-language projects with zero compromise on developer experience. We democratize enterprise-grade security for all development ecosystems - starting with Rust, Node.js, Python, and Go.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Design Principles

### 1. **Security Without Compromise**
> "Security tools must be more secure than the problems they solve"

- **Verification-First Principle**: As a security vendor, we MUST consistently promote secure practices - never show unverified downloads or execution
- **Cryptographic Verification First**: Every installer, update, and component must be cryptographically verified
- **No Pipe-to-Bash**: Force conscious verification before execution
- **Supply Chain Paranoia**: Assume all external dependencies are compromised until proven otherwise
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple overlapping security controls, not single points of failure
- **Fail Secure**: When in doubt, block rather than allow

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- **Documentation Standards**: ALL documentation must "strongly recommend" checksum verification with emphatic security language
- **No Insecure Examples**: Never show installation commands without corresponding checksum verification
- **Consistency Requirement**: Installer help, embedded docs, and website must use identical verification language
- SHA256 checksums for all downloadable components
- Sigstore/gitsign signatures for all commits and releases (keyless cryptographic signing)
- Signed commits for all repository changes with Rekor transparency log verification
- Reproducible builds with deterministic outputs
- Audit trails for all security decisions with public transparency

**Verification-First Language Standard:**
```bash
# VERIFY checksum before execution (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED - critical security practice)
```

### 2. **Don't Make Me Think (DMMT) - Universal Design Principle**
> "Make it impossible to do the wrong thing, effortless to do the right thing"

DMMT is inspired by the UK power plug design: it's physically impossible to insert incorrectly, and the earth pin opens the live/neutral shutters automatically. This is **secure by default through design**, not through documentation or user vigilance.

**Universal Applications Across System:**

**1. Automatic Correctness (Like UK Plug Orientation)**
- **Auto-Fix Security Issues**: SHA pinning, formatting, linting happen automatically
- **Impossible Wrong Configurations**: Installer validates and corrects settings
- **Self-Healing Systems**: Pre-push hooks fix issues, don't just complain
- **Smart Defaults**: Secure-by-default with zero configuration required

**2. Pit of Success Design**
- **Single Install Command**: `./install-security-controls.sh` - one command, comprehensive security
- **No Manual Steps**: Tools auto-download, verify, configure, integrate
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start minimal, automatically add security incrementally
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial features better than blocking entirely

**3. Physical/Logical Constraints (Preventing Errors)**
- **Checksum Verification Enforced**: Script won't execute until checksum verified
- **Signed Commits Only**: Pre-push hooks ensure all commits are signed
- **Pinned Actions Only**: Workflows can't use unpinned actions (auto-pinned if found)
- **No Secrets in Repo**: gitleaks blocks commits with secrets

**4. Zero Cognitive Load**
- **No Decisions Required**: Tools choose optimal security settings automatically
- **No "How" Questions**: Users shouldn't decide *how* to implement security
- **No Reading Manuals**: Security works immediately after install
- **No Remembering**: Hooks remember security requirements, developers don't have to

**5. Visibility Through Transparency (Not Invisibility)**
- **Show What Was Done**: Display auto-fixes, don't silently change things
- **Explain Why**: Error messages include rationale and impact
- **Build Trust**: Diffs and logs show all automated decisions
- **Learn Passively**: Developers absorb security best practices through use

**Design Philosophy Examples:**

```bash
# ‚ùå BAD: Make user think about how to fix
"Error: Action not pinned. Please pin to SHA."

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Fix it automatically, show what happened
"üõ† Auto-pinned actions/checkout@v4 ‚Üí 08eba0b2..."

# ‚ùå BAD: Require manual configuration
"Configure gitleaks with custom rules for your project."

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Work with zero configuration
"‚úÖ Secret scanning enabled with sensible defaults."

# ‚ùå BAD: Make wrong thing easy (pipe-to-bash)
"curl https://install.sh | bash"

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Make wrong thing impossible
"Download ‚Üí Verify Checksum ‚Üí Execute (enforced workflow)"
```

**When to Apply DMMT:**

**Auto-Fix (Zero Thought Required):**
- Deterministic fixes with one correct answer
- Zero risk of breaking functionality
- Easily reversible if needed
- Industry-standard best practices

**Guide with Clear Command (Minimal Thought):**
- Multiple valid approaches, but we recommend one
- Provide exact command to copy/paste
- Explain trade-offs briefly
- Example: "Run: `git commit --gpg-sign`"

**Block with Context (Thought Required):**
- Secrets detected (no safe auto-fix)
- Breaking changes needing review
- Multiple valid options requiring human judgment
- Always provide remediation guidance

**UK Plug Design Parallels:**
- **Physical Constraint**: Earth pin must insert first ‚Üí **Logical Constraint**: Checksum must verify first
- **Auto-Safety**: Live/neutral shutters close automatically ‚Üí **Auto-Security**: Hooks fix issues automatically
- **Impossible Wrong Use**: Can't insert upside down ‚Üí **Impossible Wrong Config**: Can't use unverified installer
- **No User Vigilance**: Works safely without thinking ‚Üí **No Developer Vigilance**: Works securely without remembering

**Performance Budget:**
- Pre-push hook: < 60 seconds total
- Individual checks: < 30 seconds each
- Tool installation: < 5 minutes
- First-time setup: < 10 minutes

### 3. **Two-Tier Security Architecture**
> "Fast blocking for critical issues, comprehensive analysis for everything else"

**Pre-Push Tier (< 60s):**
- Blocks secrets, vulnerabilities, and critical policy violations
- Provides immediate feedback to developers
- Optimized for speed and zero false positives
- Essential security controls only

**Post-Push Tier (CI Pipeline):**
- Comprehensive security analysis and reporting
- SAST, vulnerability scanning, compliance checks
- Artifact generation (SBOMs, reports, metrics)
- Human review workflows

### 4. **Cryptographic Trust Model**
> "Trust but verify, with emphasis on verify"

**Chain of Trust:**
```
Sigstore Certificate Authority ‚Üí GitHub OIDC Identity ‚Üí gitsign Signing ‚Üí Rekor Transparency Log ‚Üí Component Verification
```

**Verification Levels:**
1. **SHA256 Checksums**: Minimum verification (integrity)
2. **Sigstore/gitsign Signatures**: Recommended verification (keyless authenticity + integrity with transparency)
3. **Repository Clone**: Maximum verification (full transparency with Rekor audit trail)

**Trust Boundaries:**
- Package managers (cargo, npm, brew) - considered trusted
- GitHub releases - verify signatures
- Direct downloads - require checksums
- User-generated content - never trusted

### 5. **Ecosystem Integration**
> "Work with each language ecosystem, not against it"

- **Language-Native Tooling**: Leverage existing tooling and conventions for each language
  - **Rust**: Cargo, rustc, clippy, deny, audit
  - **Node.js**: npm, ESLint, Prettier, Snyk, retire.js
  - **Python**: pip, safety, bandit, black, flake8
  - **Go**: go toolchain, govulncheck, gofmt, golint
- **Standard Tool Chain**: Use community-standard security tools for each ecosystem
- **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing workflows in any language
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL) across all languages
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Integrate seamlessly with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

### 6. **Observable Security**
> "Security you can't measure is security you don't have"

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security decisions logged with context
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance, adoption, effectiveness metrics
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of security control evolution
- **Reporting**: Clear, actionable security reports for all stakeholders
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of security issues

### 7. **Single-Script Architecture**
> "True 1-click means zero external dependencies"

- **Standalone Installer**: Single shell script with no external dependencies
- **Built-in Components Only**: Uses only bash, curl, git, and standard Unix tools
- **Self-Contained Framework**: Error handling, logging, and rollback embedded within installer
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box on any Unix-like system
- **Offline Capable**: Core functionality works without internet (after initial download)

**Architectural Constraints:**
- No Python/Node.js/Ruby dependencies
- No package manager requirements beyond system defaults
- No external configuration files or databases
- No separate framework or library installations
- No multi-file deployments or complex directory structures

**Benefits:**
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any system with bash 3.2+
- **Zero Installation Friction**: Download one file, run one command
- **Corporate Firewall Friendly**: No complex dependency resolution
- **Airgap Compatible**: Can be transferred and run offline
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: No external code execution or network dependencies

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Embed all framework code directly in `install-security-controls.sh`
- Use bash built-ins and standard Unix utilities only
- Inline all configuration and templates as heredocs
- Self-contained error handling, logging, and rollback systems
- Progressive enhancement: add features without breaking simplicity

### 8. **Dogfooding Plus Philosophy**
> "If it's not good enough for us, it's not good enough for users"

- **Repository as Alpha Test**: This repository implements ALL security controls that the installer provides to users
- **Enhanced Development Controls**: Additional controls specific to our development needs (tool sync, docs, releases)
- **Functional Synchronization**: Automated verification that repo controls match installer templates
- **Quality Assurance Through Use**: We discover issues in our daily development before users encounter them
- **Trust Through Transparency**: Users can inspect our repository to see security controls in action

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Every security control in installer templates must exist in repository workflows
- Repository-only controls are clearly documented and justified
- Automated sync tools prevent functional drift between installer and repository
- Regular audits ensure dogfooding plus philosophy is maintained

**Benefits:**
- **Rapid Bug Discovery**: Issues surface during development before user deployment
- **Continuous Validation**: Daily development workflow validates security control effectiveness
- **User Trust**: Transparent demonstration of security controls in practice
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintains high standards through self-use

## üîß Implementation Standards

### Code Quality
- **Rust Best Practices**: Idiomatic Rust code following community standards
- **Security-First**: All code assumes hostile input and environments
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and security tests for all components
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation explaining security decisions

### Engineering Best Practices
> "Quality code is security code"

**Core Programming Principles:**
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns into reusable functions/modules
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Implement only what's needed now, avoid over-engineering
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Choose simple solutions over complex ones when both work
- **SINE (Simple Is Not Easy)**: Simple solutions require more effort and thought than complex ones
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/module has one clear purpose
- **No Special Cases**: Design general solutions rather than hardcoded exceptions
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and provide clear error messages
- **Immutable by Default**: Prefer immutable data structures and functional approaches

**External Integration Standards:**
- **Documentation-First**: Study API documentation thoroughly before implementation
- **Version Pinning**: Always pin external dependencies to specific versions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle external service failures without breaking core functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect external API limits and implement backoff strategies
- **Timeout Handling**: Set reasonable timeouts for all external calls

**Code Organization:**
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code into logical, testable modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit contracts between components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from I/O operations
- **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration, never hardcode values
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of files, connections, and other resources

**Security-Focused Development:**
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at system boundaries
- **Least Privilege**: Request minimal permissions necessary
- **Defense in Depth**: Layer multiple validation and security checks
- **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant operations with sufficient detail
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets; use secure storage mechanisms

**Performance and Reliability:**
- **Early Optimization**: Profile before optimizing, measure impact
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache expensive operations with proper invalidation
- **Memory Management**: Be conscious of memory usage and potential leaks
- **Concurrent Safety**: Design for thread safety when applicable
- **Idempotency**: Operations should be safe to retry

### Tool Integration

  - Community adoption and maintenance
  - Performance characteristics
  - Integration complexity
  - False positive rates
  - Security effectiveness

- **Tool Configuration**:
  - Sensible security-focused defaults
  - Customizable for different project needs
  - Performance-optimized settings
  - Clear documentation of trade-offs

### Performance Requirements
- **Pre-Push Hook Performance**:
  - Total time: < 60 seconds
  - Individual tools: < 30 seconds
  - Parallel execution where possible
  - Caching for repeated operations

- **Installation Performance**:
  - Full setup: < 10 minutes
  - Tool downloads: Progress indicators
  - Network resilience: Retry logic
  - Offline operation: Cached tools when possible

## üìã Security Control Framework

### Control Categories

**Tier 1 - Critical (Pre-Push Blocking)**
- Secret detection (gitleaks)
- Known vulnerabilities (cargo-deny)
- Code quality (cargo clippy)
- Test failures (cargo test)
- License violations (cargo-deny)
- Supply chain attacks (pinact)

**Tier 2 - Important (CI Analysis)**
- Static analysis (Semgrep, CodeQL)
- Unsafe code detection (cargo-geiger)
- SBOM generation (cargo-auditable)
- Compliance checks (various)
- Security metrics (OpenSSF Scorecard)

**Tier 3 - Valuable (Optional/Advanced)**
- Fuzzing (cargo-fuzz)
- Binary analysis
- Container scanning
- Infrastructure analysis

### Control Selection Criteria

**Pre-Push Controls Must:**
- Execute in < 30 seconds individually
- Have < 1% false positive rate
- Block genuine security risks
- Provide clear remediation guidance
- Work reliably across platforms

**CI Controls May:**
- Take longer execution time
- Generate complex reports
- Require human review
- Have higher false positive rates
- Depend on external services

---

## üé® User Experience Principles

### Installation Experience
- **Verification-First**: Never allow unverified execution
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic options first, advanced on request
- **Sensible Defaults**: Work out-of-the-box for 80% of projects
- **Clear Feedback**: Progress indicators and status messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial installation better than complete failure

### Developer Workflow
- **Invisible When Working**: Security runs automatically without intervention
- **Visible When Broken**: Clear, actionable error messages with fixes
- **Respectful of Time**: Fast feedback loops, no waiting
- **Learning Oriented**: Help developers understand security concepts
- **Emergency Friendly**: Bypass mechanisms for critical fixes

### Error Messages and Guidance
```bash
‚ùå Security vulnerabilities found in dependencies
   
   Affected crates:
   ‚Ä¢ serde_json 1.0.50 (RUSTSEC-2020-0001: Stack overflow in Value::clone)
   
   Fix: cargo update serde_json
   
   For emergency bypass: git push --no-verify
   (Use bypass only for critical hotfixes)
```

### Documentation Organization and User Journey
- **Quickstart First**: Always put installation and quickstart guides at the top of documentation lists
- **Cognitive Load Minimization**: Order content by user journey complexity (basic ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí expert)
- **Smooth Flow and Pacing**: Optimize information architecture for immediate action, then progressive learning
- **User-Centric Navigation**: Structure all documentation around user intent, not system architecture

**Implementation Standards:**
- **New Users**: Quick Start ‚Üí Installation Guide ‚Üí Basic Configuration
- **Power Users**: Architecture ‚Üí Advanced Features ‚Üí Customization
- **Contributors**: Contributing Guide ‚Üí Technical Details ‚Üí Design Principles
- **Navigation Order**: Get Started ‚Üí Power Users ‚Üí Development/Contributing
- **Link Organization**: Essential actions before technical deep-dives

**Rationale**: Users arrive with specific intents - most want to get started quickly. Bury advanced technical details below actionable guides to reduce abandonment and improve success rates.

### Visual Priority and Reading Patterns
- **Left-to-Right Priority**: Place highest priority information in leftmost columns (users read left‚Üíright, top‚Üíbottom)
- **Scannable Priority**: Use visual indicators (emojis, colors, typography) in the leftmost position for instant priority recognition
- **Table Design**: Priority column should be first column, followed by identification, then details
- **Executive Readability**: Senior management should see critical vs. non-critical items within first 2 seconds of scanning

**Examples:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Good: | üö® CRITICAL | V1 | Identity Spoofing | ...
‚ùå Bad:  | V1 | Identity Spoofing | ... | üö® CRITICAL
```

**Rationale**: Human reading patterns follow F-pattern (focus on left edge), so priority indicators must be positioned where attention naturally falls first.

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Adding New Security Controls

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Security Value**: Does it prevent real attacks?
2. **Performance Impact**: Fits within tier performance budgets?
3. **False Positive Rate**: < 1% for pre-push, < 10% for CI?
4. **Community Adoption**: Widely used and maintained?
5. **Integration Complexity**: Reasonable implementation effort?
6. **Single-Script Compatibility**: Can be embedded without external dependencies?

**Implementation Process:**
1. **Research**: Tool capabilities, community feedback, alternatives
2. **Prototype**: Minimal implementation and testing
3. **Performance Test**: Measure impact on different project sizes
4. **Documentation**: Update architecture and usage documentation
5. **Rollout**: Gradual deployment with monitoring

### Task Prioritization: "Informed Frog Eating" Approach

**Philosophy**: Optimize for both peak cognitive utilization and context building through strategic task sequencing.

**Three-Phase Process:**

**Phase 1: Rapid Reconnaissance (2-3 minutes)**
- Quick scan of ALL tasks to identify true complexity and scope
- Surface hidden dependencies, cascade effects, and blockers
- Assess context switching costs and information requirements
- Map relationships between tasks (which enable/block others)

**Phase 2: Strategic Prioritization**
- **Eat the Frog IF**: Clear scope + no dependencies + truly blocking other work
- **Build Context IF**: Multiple simple tasks create foundational understanding for complex work
- **Parallel Process IF**: Can batch related tasks efficiently with shared context
- **Defer Complex IF**: Insufficient information or context requires preliminary work

**Phase 3: Adaptive Execution**
- Monitor for emerging blockers and complexity escalation
- Switch to frog-eating mode when blockers become apparent
- Continue context-building on simple tasks when they inform complex work
- Batch context-heavy operations (file reads, system analysis)

**Decision Matrix:**
```
High Impact + High Complexity + Clear Scope = EAT THE FROG üê∏
High Impact + Low Complexity = BUILD CONTEXT FIRST ‚ö°
Low Impact + High Complexity = DEFER OR ELIMINATE ‚è∏Ô∏è
Multiple Related Tasks = BATCH PROCESS üì¶
```

**Applied Examples:**
- **Frog**: Establishing core security principles (affects all documentation)
- **Context**: Fixing typos across multiple files (builds codebase understanding)
- **Batch**: Reading multiple config files for comprehensive understanding
- **Defer**: Complex refactoring when requirements are still unclear

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Starting complex work without understanding full scope
- ‚ùå Building context through work that will be invalidated by harder tasks
- ‚ùå Context switching between unrelated complex problems
- ‚ùå Avoiding hard but critical decisions that block progress

### File Management and Impact Analysis

**Critical Rule**: File renames, moves, and deletions require comprehensive impact analysis across the entire codebase.

**Problem**: When files are renamed or moved, references can be scattered across:
- Documentation internal links
- CI/CD workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- Scripts and automation tools
- Configuration files (`mkdocs.yml`, `lychee.toml`)
- Installer script embedded documentation
- Cross-references in other documentation

**Required Process for File Changes:**
1. **Pre-Change Analysis**: Search globally for ALL references to the file(s)
   ```bash
   # Search git-tracked files for references (most important)
   git grep -n "old-filename\.md"
   git grep -n "OLD_FILENAME"
   git grep -n "old_filename"

   # Also search filesystem for broader analysis (optional)
   rg "old-filename\.md"  # includes untracked files, may find additional references

   # Find actual files being renamed/moved
   fd "old-filename" || find . -name "*old-filename*" -type f
   ```

2. **Multi-Dimensional Update**: Update ALL discovered references simultaneously:
   - Documentation links and cross-references
   - Workflow trigger paths and file lists
   - Script file arguments and parameters
   - Configuration navigation and includes
   - Any hardcoded file paths or names

3. **Validation**: Test all affected systems after changes:
   ```bash
   # Test documentation builds
   mkdocs build
   # Test workflow validation
   ./scripts/validate-docs.sh
   # Test link checking
   lychee docs/**/*.md README.md
   ```

**Common Failure Pattern**:
- ‚ùå Updating documentation links but forgetting workflow files
- ‚ùå Updating workflows but missing configuration files
- ‚ùå Updating repository files but missing installer script references
- ‚ùå Moving files without checking cross-references

**Success Pattern**:
- ‚úÖ Global search reveals ALL references before making changes
- ‚úÖ All references updated atomically in same commit
- ‚úÖ Validation tools run to confirm no broken links or references
- ‚úÖ CI workflows tested to ensure they pass after changes

**Lesson**: File structural changes are **multi-dimensional operations** that require systematic impact analysis across all project components. The synchronization complexity described in `docs/repo-security-and-quality-assurance.md` applies to file management operations as well.

### Documentation Link Format Standards (GitHub + MkDocs)

**Critical Rule**: Understand how different tools interpret documentation links and use appropriate formats for each context.

**Context**: These standards are optimized for GitHub repositories with MkDocs documentation sites and lychee link validation.

**Problem**: Documentation systems use different link formatting conventions, leading to validation failures when formats are mixed incorrectly:

**MkDocs vs Lychee Link Interpretation**:
- **MkDocs** (site generation): Converts directory-style links (`installation/`) to proper web URLs
- **Lychee** (link validation): Interprets links literally as file system paths during CI validation
- **Mixed formats** cause CI failures when lychee can't find files that MkDocs handles correctly

**Link Format Standards by Context**:

1. **Internal Documentation Links** (within docs/ folder):
   ```markdown
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT - Direct file references
   [Installation Guide](installation.md)
   [Security Architecture](architecture.md)
   [4-Mode Signing Configuration](installation.md#4-configure-commit-signing-4-modes-available)

   # ‚ùå INCORRECT - Directory-style (breaks lychee)
   [Installation Guide](installation/)
   [Security Architecture](architecture/)
   ```

2. **Documentation Site URLs** (external references):
   ```markdown
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT - No trailing slashes
   https://h4x0r.github.io/1-click-github-sec/installation
   https://h4x0r.github.io/1-click-github-sec/architecture

   # ‚ùå INCORRECT - Trailing slashes (404 errors)
   https://h4x0r.github.io/1-click-github-sec/installation/
   https://h4x0r.github.io/1-click-github-sec/architecture/
   ```

3. **GitHub Repository Links**:
   ```markdown
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT - Full GitHub URLs for directories
   [Workflow Sources](https://github.com/h4x0r/1-click-github-sec/tree/main/.github/workflows)

   # ‚ùå INCORRECT - Relative paths to directories
   [Workflow Sources](.github/workflows/)
   ```

**Validation Process for Links**:
1. **Test with MkDocs**: `mkdocs build` - ensures site generates correctly
2. **Test with Lychee**: `lychee docs/**/*.md README.md` - ensures CI validation passes
3. **Manual Verification**: Click links in both rendered site and raw markdown

**Common Failure Patterns**:
- ‚ùå Using MkDocs-style directory links (`installation/`) in contexts where lychee validates
- ‚ùå Adding trailing slashes to documentation site URLs
- ‚ùå Using relative paths for repository directory references
- ‚ùå Mixing link formats without testing both rendering and validation

**Success Pattern**:
- ‚úÖ Use file extensions (`.md`) for internal documentation links
- ‚úÖ Use clean URLs without trailing slashes for external documentation site links
- ‚úÖ Use full GitHub URLs for repository directory and file references
- ‚úÖ Test links with both MkDocs build and lychee validation
- ‚úÖ Maintain consistency within each link type category

**Tools and Commands**:
```bash
# Test MkDocs rendering
mkdocs build -d site

# Test lychee link validation
lychee docs/**/*.md README.md --config lychee.toml

# Test both in CI pipeline
.github/workflows/docs.yml
```

**Lesson**: Documentation link formats must be **context-appropriate** and **tool-compatible**. Different tools have different expectations, and mixing formats without understanding the interpretation differences causes validation failures. Always test links with both rendering and validation tools.

**Scope Limitation**: These guidelines are specific to GitHub + MkDocs + lychee workflows. Other documentation ecosystems (GitLab + Hugo, Bitbucket + Jekyll, etc.) may have different link format requirements.

### Preferred Development Tools

**Critical Rule**: Use the fastest, most reliable tools available for common operations.

**Modern Development Tools** (use when available, with fallbacks):

**Search and File Operations**:
- **git grep** - Search git-tracked files (repository scope, most accurate for version control)
- **ripgrep (`rg`)** - Search filesystem (broader scope, 10-100x faster than grep, respects .gitignore)
- **fd (`fd`)** - Find files (faster than find, simpler syntax, respects .gitignore)
- **/bin/ls** - Use full path to bypass slow aliases (developers often alias ls to colorized versions)

**Package Managers** (by ecosystem):
- **pnpm** over npm - Faster installs, disk space efficient, strict dependency resolution
- **bun** - Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **uv** over pip - Extremely fast Python package manager (10-100x faster)

**Developer Experience**:
- **zoxide (`z`)** - Smart cd that learns your patterns
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finder for files, history, processes
- **delta** - Better git diff with syntax highlighting
- **dust (`dust`)** - Disk usage analyzer (better than du)
- **procs** - Modern ps with tree view and search
- **sd** - Intuitive sed alternative for find-and-replace
- **tokei** - Fast code statistics (lines of code, languages)

**Tool Selection by Use Case**:
```bash
# Search git-tracked files (most common for repository analysis)
git grep "pattern"                    # searches git index
git grep -n "pattern"                 # with line numbers

# Search all files (broader analysis, includes untracked)
rg "pattern"                          # fast filesystem search
rg "pattern" --type py                # specific file types
rg "pattern" -A 3 -B 3               # with context

# Find files (locate files by name/pattern)
fd "filename"                         # fast file finding
fd -e py                              # by extension
fd -t f "pattern"                     # files only

# List files (bypass slow aliases)
/bin/ls -la                           # use full path to bypass colorized aliases
command ls -la                        # alternative: use command builtin
\\ls -la                              # alternative: escape alias with backslash

# Package management (JavaScript)
pnpm install                          # faster, more efficient
bun install                           # ultra-fast alternative
npm install                           # fallback

# Package management (Python)
uv pip install package                # extremely fast pip replacement
pip install package                   # fallback

# Find-and-replace
sd "old" "new" file                   # intuitive sed alternative
sed 's/old/new/g' file               # fallback

# Tool availability checks
command -v pnpm >/dev/null && pnpm install || npm install
command -v uv >/dev/null && uv pip install package || pip install package

# Fast ls (bypass aliases)
/bin/ls -la                           # always use native ls for performance
```

**Why These Tools Matter**:
- **Performance**: 10-100x speed improvement for large codebases and operations
- **Ergonomics**: Better defaults, cleaner output, more intuitive syntax
- **Git Integration**: Automatically respects .gitignore, shows git status, integrates with workflows
- **Developer Experience**: Syntax highlighting, fuzzy finding, intelligent suggestions
- **Modern Standards**: Becoming standard in modern development environments
- **Disk Efficiency**: Tools like pnpm save significant disk space and bandwidth

**Installation Check**:
```bash
# Core modern tools check
echo "Checking modern development tools..."
command -v rg && echo "‚úÖ ripgrep" || echo "‚ùå ripgrep (install: brew install ripgrep)"
command -v fd && echo "‚úÖ fd" || echo "‚ùå fd (install: brew install fd)"

### Preserving Single-Script Architecture

**Critical Design Decision**: The installer must remain a single, standalone shell script with zero external dependencies.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Corporate environments often restrict external dependencies
- **Security Posture**: Minimizes attack surface and supply chain risks
- **Reliability**: No complex dependency resolution or version conflicts
- **Universality**: Works on any Unix-like system without preparation

**Development Guidelines:**
- **Embed, Don't Import**: All framework code must be inline within the installer
- **Standard Tools Only**: bash, curl, git, awk, sed - no Python/Node.js/Ruby
- **Self-Contained Templates**: Use heredocs for all configuration templates
- **No External Files**: All logic, configuration, and data embedded in script
- **Progressive Degradation**: Features work without internet when possible

**Rejected Approaches:**
- ‚ùå Separate framework files that must be sourced
- ‚ùå Package manager dependencies (pip, npm, gem)
- ‚ùå External configuration databases or files
- ‚ùå Multi-file installer packages
- ‚ùå Docker containers or virtual environments

**Approved Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ Embedded error handling frameworks
- ‚úÖ Inline logging and rollback systems
- ‚úÖ Heredoc-based configuration templates
- ‚úÖ Built-in retry and timeout mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Self-contained testing and validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Timing and resource usage
- **Security Tests**: Verify security controls actually work
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Real-world usage scenarios

### Release Process
1. **Version Bumping**: **CRITICAL - Always use `./scripts/version-sync.sh X.Y.Z`** to maintain consistency across:
   - VERSION file (Single Source of Truth)
   - README.md version badge
   - install-security-controls.sh SCRIPT_VERSION
   - mkdocs.yml site version
   - CHANGELOG.md entries (manual verification)
   - **Never manually update version numbers** - this causes CI validation failures
2. **Testing**: Full test suite on multiple platforms
3. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation
4. **Signing**: Sigstore/gitsign sign all commits and release tags (cryptographically verifiable via Rekor transparency log)
5. **Checksums**: Generate and publish SHA256 hashes for release artifacts
6. **Announcement**: Security-focused release notes with cryptographic verification instructions

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

The **Core Design Principles** (¬ß 1-8 above) represent our foundational architectural decisions. This section provides a compact cross-reference table:

| ADR | Principle | Key Constraint | Primary Trade-off |
|-----|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **001** | Security Without Compromise (¬ß 1) | Cryptographic verification required for all components | ‚ùå Cannot use unverified tools |
| **002** | Don't Make Me Think (¬ß 2) | Auto-fix when safe; make wrong thing impossible | ‚ùå Complex implementation for safe auto-fixes |
| **003** | Two-Tier Architecture (¬ß 3) | Pre-push < 60s; CI comprehensive | ‚ùå Deep analysis deferred to CI |
| **004** | Cryptographic Trust Model (¬ß 4) | SHA256 minimum; Sigstore recommended | ‚ùå Additional release complexity |
| **005** | Ecosystem Integration (¬ß 5) | Use language-native tooling | ‚ùå Must maintain multi-language expertise |
| **006** | Observable Security (¬ß 6) | All security decisions logged | ‚ùå Log management overhead |
| **007** | Single-Script Architecture (¬ß 7) | Zero external dependencies | ‚ùå Cannot use external frameworks |
| **008** | Dogfooding Plus (¬ß 8) | Repository uses all installer controls + dev-specific extras | ‚ùå Functional sync maintenance burden |

**External Service Constraints** (applies to all):
- ‚ùå No external account registration required (violates 1-click principle)
- ‚ùå No GitHub App installation required (violates zero out-of-band setup)
- ‚úÖ GitHub-native features preferred (CodeQL, Renovate, secret scanning)
- ‚úÖ Downloadable tools with checksums accepted

**Tool Rejection Examples**: Socket.dev, Snyk Cloud, Semgrep Cloud (all require external accounts)

**Documentation Strategy**:
- **CLAUDE.md**: Authoritative design principles and ADR cross-reference
- **README.md**: User-facing philosophy with examples
- **SECURITY_CONTROLS_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Implementation details

**Process**: All decisions must align with these principles. Principle changes require updating all three documents.
